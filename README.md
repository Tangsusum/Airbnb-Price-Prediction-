# Airbnb-Price-Prediction-

Airbnb is an online marketplace where hosts are able to offer their properties for short-term rental.
Airbnb has become increasingly popular where Australia has seen a surge in Airbnb listings. For hosts
to offer their property for rental, they must decide on the listing price. However, determining the
optimal price is difficult and is often seen as a major concern for property hosts. Therefore, it presents
a need for a Machine Learning tool to accurately predict Airbnb prices.

It is hypothesised that the number of accommodates, property size and location are the
major factors in predicting house prices. The hypothesis is analysed through exploratory data analysis
(EDA) where interesting relationships are observed between price and predictors. Linear regression model is used as the base line and is
compared to more complex models such as XG Boosting, Light GBM, random forest, gradient boosting and the stacking model. The models
are validated through k fold cross validation and evaluated using the test root mean square
logarithm error (RMSLE).

Our data mining model suggest features relating to the size, location and
some other characteristics such as additional charges are of critical importance in determining the
house price. These predictors are generally aligned with our hypothesis.
